# Solubility Calculator (Version: 1.3.1)

## Description

The Solubility Calculator is a Python program that calculates the solubility of a polymer in a solvent and provides information on how easily the polymer will dissolve.

## Features

- Calculates the solubility of a polymer in a given solvent.
- Provides a relative measure of how easily the polymer will dissolve.
- Generates a 3D presentation illustrating the solubility.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies (requirements.txt)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Python 3.8+ if not already installed.
3. run the bat installation files on windows.


## Usage

1. Navigate to the directory where the program is located.
2. Run entry.bat on windows to open the data of solvents (to add and remove or to choose which solvents and polymeres you want to see).
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the necessary information.
4. Run the main.bat file on windows to open the 3D presentor
5. View the generated 3D presentation to visualize the solubility.
